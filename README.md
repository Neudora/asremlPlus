# asremlPlus
asremlPlus is an R package that augments the use of 'ASReml-R' and 'ASReml4-R' in fitting mixed models

This version is compatible with both ASReml-R versions 3 and 4. ASReml-R version 4 is currently undergoing $\beta$-testing and 
has some changes in syntax that necessitate changes in asremlPlus. 

Versions of asremlPlus 4.x-xx are a major revamp of the package and also include substantial syntax changes.
